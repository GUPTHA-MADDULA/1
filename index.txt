A digital clock is a modern timekeeping device that displays the time in numeric format rather than using clock hands. These clocks are widely used due to their precision, ease of reading, and additional functionalities.

### Features of a Digital Clock:
- Displays time using electronic segments or LED/LCD screens.
- Offers high accuracy with minimal maintenance.
- Can include features like alarms, calendars, and temperature indicators.
- Often battery-powered or connected to an electric power source.

### How It Works:
Digital clocks rely on quartz crystal oscillators, which vibrate at a stable frequency when an electric current is applied. These vibrations are counted and converted into time increments, which are then displayed on the screen.

### Common Applications:
- Used in households as wall-mounted or bedside alarm clocks.
- Integrated into mobile phones, smart devices, and computers.
- Installed in car dashboards for convenient time display.
- Seen in public spaces such as railway stations, airports, and offices for easy time tracking.

Digital clocks continue to be an essential part of daily life, ensuring accurate
